# hello-world
A repository for learning

Hey all, I am excited to begin my career in International Development with DevTech and look forward to meeting you all over the next few weeks/months. I am a recent graduate of GWU with an MPH in Global Health focused on program design, monitoring, and evaluation. I received a BS in Neuroscience from Christopher Newport University in 2016 with a focus on neuroendocrinology and the neurobiology of learning and memory.

In my free time I am passionate about volunteering and provide free program consulting and data analysis to the Mount Vernon based Acquiring Knowledge for Transcendence and the internationally based Kibale Ecohealth Group. For leisure, I enjoy home brewing and playing guitar and bass with friends and family. I also coach and referee youth basketball and play soccer, basketball, racquetball, and tennis with friends and in local leagues. My guilty pleasure is pinball (Attack from Mars is my favorite so far).
